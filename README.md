# Crop-Yield Prediction

## Overview
Predict crop yield using environmental and soil features from the [Agricultural Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) (Kaggle).

## Files
- `Crop_Yield_Submission.ipynb` – Complete Colab notebook with data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and evaluation.
- `preprocessed_crop_yield.csv` – Cleaned and preprocessed dataset used for modeling.
- `feature_importances.csv` – Top features contributing to predictions.

## Models
- RandomForestRegressor
- LinearRegression (optional)

## Evaluation
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE
- Graphs: Actual vs Predicted, Residuals, Feature Importance

## Usage
1. Open `Crop_Yield_Submission.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Download results and feature importance CSVs if needed.
